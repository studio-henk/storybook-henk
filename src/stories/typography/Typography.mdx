# Typography

Typography is a key part of our design system. It defines how we present content consistently across products, ensuring **clarity, hierarchy, and brand identity**.

---

## Typeface

Our primary typeface is:

**Neue Haas Grotesk Text (Round Dots)**  
Available in the following styles:  

- 55 Roman  
- 56 Italic  
- 65 Medium  
- 66 Medium Italic  
- 75 Bold  
- 76 Bold Italic  

> These styles are provided as WOFF files for web usage.  
> Italic styles exist, but should be used sparingly for emphasis only.

## Type Scale

We use a **Major Third** scale as the default, with a custom scale available as an alternative.  
This provides a balanced progression from small captions to large headings.

ðŸ‘‰ See [Size](?path=/docs/typography-size--docs) for details.

## Principles

- **Consistency** â†’ Use defined tokens for all typography.  
- **Hierarchy** â†’ Communicate structure with font size, weight, and spacing.  
- **Readability** â†’ Base font size is 16px, with line-height ~1.4â€“1.6.  
- **Restraint** â†’ Stick to Roman, Medium, and Bold for most UI; italics are the exception.
